The Poetry of Donald J. Trump
-----------------------------

On a plane
^^^^^^^^^^

::

    On a plane with thugs
    Wearing these dark uniforms
    With gear this and that

    From a certain city
    These black uniforms with gear
    They're on a plane

Diagnosis
^^^^^^^^^

::

    The President is closely watched
    His condition continues to improve
    There are frequent ups and downs

    Every finding is Science and Literature
    His oxygen transients outweigh his obesity
    He is maxxing it out.

    An evening outting is scheduled
    to infect Secret Service personel
    His course of illness is upbeat
